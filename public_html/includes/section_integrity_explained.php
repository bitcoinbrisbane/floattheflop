						What is collusion?
					</h3>
						<p>In poker, collusion is when two or more people sitting at a poker table are working together to achieve the same combined objective, and in online poker, this can be extended to where one person plays multiple hands on the same table.</p>

						What is Real Anti-Collusion Software (RACS)?&trade;

						<p>RACS&trade; is Float The Flops&trade; proprietary software consisting of a vast set of quantitative algorithms that detect highly unusual and uncharacteristic behavior across a large number of poker hands.</p><p>This odd behavior results in a player creating an excessive winning edge which is not in-line with the laws of probability or even the most advanced online gameplay.</p>

					Why is RACS essential for online poker?
				</h3>
				<div class="mr-4">
					<p>Have you ever felt like the odds were against you after a session of online poker? Have you noticed that you keep getting run down in big pots, often losing to a couple of outs? Have you suspected that you are being cheated?</p>
					<p>Put simply, it's possible you were cheated, not by the platform as platforms aren't rigged, but by one or more players that lack integrity. Sure, the average platform has its so-called Anti-Collusions systems which include the standard IP and GPS tracking but let's face it, they are only effective to a certain extent.</p>

					IP Tracking
				</h3>
				<p>IP Tracking simply traces the last location your internet traffic goes through before it gets to the poker app. So to circumvent this, people just use a proxy server so that the poker app sees the servers IP address instead of their own, it's pretty basic stuff. They can also just call their mate over the phone and collude via two different IP addresses, it's not hard.</p>
				<p>Don't get us wrong, IP tracking has its place, its the initial filter used to weed out the unsophisticated cheat.</p>

					GPS Tracking
				</h3>
			<p>GPS Tracking is much the same as IP tracking, it just tracks the mobile tower you're connected to. GPS tracking has the same flaws, the same workarounds, and can be circumvented by anyone.</p>

					Machine ID Tracking
				</h3>
			<p>Machine ID Tracking is a stronger type of anti-collusion detection than IP and GPS tracking. It's not available on many platforms at all, but fortunately, uPoker, the poker app that Float uses does have it.</p>
			<p>A Machine ID is a long series of numbers and letters that uniquely identify a device. Changing or cloaking a machine ID requires a bit more sophistication so this system does help weed out more cheats than others.</p>

						<p>
						We were tired of seeing every club promoting GPS and IP tracking like its something special, something that's going to protect their members from cheats. They know as well as we do, that to get around these protective measures, it's pretty straight forward.

						<p>
						Let's cut to the chase, online poker has failed to protect its players, it has failed in providing a fair game of poker, and we want to change that.

						 What is a Random Number Generator (RNG)?
						</h5>
						<p>A random number generator is a device that generates a sequence of numbers or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by a random chance.</p>
						<p>A true random card is one that is drawn from a set of possible cards from within the remaining deck, each of which is equally probable, i.e. a uniform distribution. When considering a sequence of random cards in poker, each card drawn must be statistically independent of the others.</p>

						How accurate are Gaming Labs Random Number Tests?
						</h3>
						<p>
						Gaming Labs has the most experienced and robust Random Number Generator testing methodologies in the world. This includes software-based (pseudo-algorithmic) RNG’s, Hardware RNG’s, and hybrid combinations of both.
						</p>
						<p>
						Gaming Labs uses custom software written and validated through the collaborative effort of their in-house mathematicians and industry consultants since their inception in 1989. An RNG Test Suite is applied for randomness testing. GLI also uses software to perform certain calculations, estimations, and graphical plotting with the data used during the evaluation.
